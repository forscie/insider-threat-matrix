# Forscie® Insider Threat Matrix™

The [Insider Threat Matrix™ (ITM)](https://insiderthreatmatrix.org) is designed to help investigators map the trajectory of an insider incident—both before and after an infringement. It provides a structured approach to categorizing evidence and articulating the **motive**, **means**, and **methods** used by subjects of insider investigations.

The ITM unifies diverse concepts and terminology for digital investigators, offering a common language that bridges people, processes, and technology. Its goal is to improve how we address the growing challenge of computer-enabled insider threats.

The Insider Threat Matrix™ is a living framework, continuously evolving as new insights and research emerge. If you believe you can contribute to its development, please submit your input [here](https://insiderthreatmatrix.org/contributors).
